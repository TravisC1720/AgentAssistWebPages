    <h1>Process Billing Resubmission
    </h1>

We no longer ask the order processing team to stamp or write the word “corrected” on the corrected order submission. <br>

Correcting an order <br>

Enter the Order Type code (billing code) 7 for a replacement/correction, or 8 to void a prior order, in the 2300 loop in the CLM*05 03. <br>
Enter the original order number in the 2300 loop in the REF*F8*.<br>

<p1>Voiding an order
<br>
Complete box 22 (Resubmission Code) to include a 7 (the "Replace" code) to notify us of a corrected or a voided order, or insert an 8 (the “Void” billing code) to let us know you are voiding a previously submitted order .Enter the original order number as the Original Ref. No., or if that information is not available, enter the DCN [Document Control Number].
<br>
The voided order should be submitted with ALL line items completed for that specific claim, and they should never be filed with just the line items that need to be corrected.<br>
This information will also be documented in our process manual, Blue Book, during the next update cycle.
