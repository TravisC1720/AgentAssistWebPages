How to Check Account Balance
Knowing your account balance is valuable. It can help you avoid Overdraft Fees and Monthly Maintenance Fees. With online bank statements, as well as online and mobile banking, it’s simple to stay in the know.
It's fast and easy to check your account balance or access your bank statement if you’re a ABC Online Banking customer. Simply go to our website and log into your account, where your account number and balance will appear on the screen. From here, you can see your account history including purchases, deposits and pending transactions.
There are two ways to measure your balance: 
1.	Current balance - tells you the amount of money you have in your checking account including pending transactions. 
2.	Available balance - refers to the amount of money you can use right away, therefore this excludes your pending transactions. It’s important to regularly check your account balance and balance your checkbook to avoid dipping below your minimum balance or getting charged an Overdraft Fee.
Checking your account balance on the ABC Mobile app? The balance displayed is today’s beginning balance plus any pending transactions.
If you are enrolled in online statements, or would like to enroll, head to the statements tab of your Online Banking profile. You can view, print or download up to two years of bank statements.

What is a minimum balance?
Depending on what checking account you have, you might need to meet a minimum balance to avoid a Monthly Maintenance Fee. The minimum balance varies for each account, and with ABC’s Asterisk-Free Checking, there is no minimum balance or Monthly Maintenance Fee.
